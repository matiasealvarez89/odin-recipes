        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This is the best lasagna we have ever had, including restaurants! Great with a salad and 
            garlic bread.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>    

        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>3 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>    

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until al dente. 
                Rinse with cool water. Drain.</li>
            <li>In large sauce pan cook ground beef. Drain excess grease. Combine tomato sauces and 
                tomato paste with ground beef and simmer until bubbly. Add garlic salt and Italian 
                seasoning and reduce heat to low simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.
            </li>    
            <li>To assemble, in the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking dish spread a thin layer of sauce. 
                Next, add a layer of noodles, ricotta cheese, sauce/ground beef mixture, and then 
                grated mozzarella cheese. Repeat until baking dish is filled. Garnish top with 
                additional shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>In a preheated 375 degree F(190 degree C) oven bake for 30 minutes or until bubbly. 
                Let stand for 15 minutes and serve.
            </li>
